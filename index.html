            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and
                accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term
                socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the
                Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                As society becomes ever more complex and schools become ever more institutionalized, educational
                experience becomes less directly related to daily life, less a matter of showing and learning in the
                context of the workaday world, and more abstracted from practice, more a matter of distilling, telling,
                and learning things out of context. This concentration of learning in a formal atmosphere allows
                children to learn far more of their culture than they are able to do by merely observing and imitating.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A primitive person, whose culture is the totality of his universe, has a
                relatively fixed sense of cultural continuity and timelessness. The model of life is relatively static
                and absolute, and it is transmitted from one generation to another with little deviation. As for
                prehistoric education, it can only be inferred from educational practices in surviving primitive
                cultures. </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The purpose of primitive education is thus to guide children to becoming good members of their tribe or
                band. There is a marked emphasis upon training for citizenship, because primitive people are highly
                concerned with the growth of individuals as tribal members and the thorough comprehension of their way
                of life during passage from prepuberty to postpuberty.Because of the variety in the countless thousands
                of primitive cultures, it is difficult to describe any standard and uniform characteristics of
                prepuberty education.</p>
